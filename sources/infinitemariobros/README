This is a clone of Infinite Mario, written in JavaScript for web browsers using HTML5.

A good demonstration of what can be accomplished with the Canvas and Audio elements.

Background music currently does not work in any browser besides Firefox 4. I think. There were too many problems with other browsers.

Ported from the Java version by Notch (Markus Persson).
