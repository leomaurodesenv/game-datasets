# :video_game: Awesome Game Datasets [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

In computer science, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines. Its definition, AI research as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that achieving its goals _Russell et. al (2016)_.   

Withal, Data Mining (DM) is the process of discovering patterns in data sets (or datasets) involving methods of machine learning, statistics, and database systems; DM focus on extract the information of datasets _Han (2011)_.  

This repository serves as a guide for anyone who wants to work with **Artificial Intelligence** or **Data Mining** applied in digital games! Here you will find a series of datasets, tools and materials available to build your _application_ or _dataset_.
