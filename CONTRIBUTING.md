## Suggested Projects

To stay on the list, projects are suggested to be related to:

- Game
- Dataset
- Database
- Data Mining
- Artificial Intelligence
- Either:
  - free to use, or
  - open source (not limited to GitHub), or
  - has a documentated machine readable interface (e.g. database)

It's hard to define what is related and what is not. When in doubt, just open an issue to discuss.
